# Fractal-Image-Compression
Implementation of the basic procedure of fractal compression of still images, as well as the selected fast algorithm for fractal compression. 

Namely, image compression procedures reduce the resources needed to store and transfer digital images.

Fractal image compression is a lossy compression process that is independent of image resolution. The advantages of fractal image compression are a large compression ratio, simple and fast decoding process,
and good quality of the reconstructed image. 
Execution time and computational complexity of the coding process in fractal image compression are its main drawbacks. 

This is an implementation of the basic algorithm with exhaustive block search, as well as the fast algorithm with DCT-based block classification scheme. 

Based on the obtained results of both algorithms, with the selected fast algorithm the fractal coding execution time is reduced approximately three times compared to the basic
fractal coding algorithm. The quality of the reconstructed image is also preserved.
